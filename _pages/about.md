<span id="about"></span>
I am currently a Lecturer and Master's Supervisor at the School of Internet of Things, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT). My research focuses on **network reliability**, **fault-tolerant computing**, and their applications in **data center networks** and **cloud computing**. I have published over 20 papers in prestigious international journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Reliability, The Computer Journal, and Theoretical Computer Science.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from Soochow University in June 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Jianxi Fan. During my doctoral studies, I was honored with the National Scholarship for Doctoral Students 🏆 and received the Special Prize Scholarship twice (highest honor).

I am a member of the China Computer Federation (CCF) and serve as a reviewer for several international journals including IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Theoretical Computer Science, The Computer Journal, and Journal of Supercomputing.
