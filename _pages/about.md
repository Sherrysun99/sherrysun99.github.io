<span id="about"></span>
I am currently a Lecturer and Master's Supervisor at the School of Internet of Things, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT). My research focuses on **network reliability**, **fault-tolerant computing**, and their applications in **data center networks** and **cloud computing**. I have published **29 papers** in prestigious international journals and conferences, including **12 papers in CCF Rank B and above journals** (including 2 CCF A papers) such as IEEE Transactions on Computers **(CCF A)**, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, The Computer Journal, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, and Theoretical Computer Science.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from Soochow University in June 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Jianxi Fan. During my doctoral studies, I was honored with the National Scholarship for Doctoral Students 🏆, received the Special Prize Scholarship twice, and led the Graduate Research Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (2021-2022).

I am a member of the China Computer Federation (CCF) and serve as a reviewer for several international journals including IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Theoretical Computer Science, The Computer Journal, and Journal of Supercomputing.
