## Biography

I am Xueli Sun (孙雪丽), a Lecturer and Master's Supervisor at the School of Internet of Things, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT). I am also a member of the China Computer Federation (CCF).

I received my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from Soochow University in June 2023. Since August 2023, I have been working as a faculty member at NJUPT. During my doctoral studies, I was awarded the National Scholarship for Doctoral Students and received the Special Prize Scholarship twice (highest honor). I also led a Graduate Research Innovation Program project.

I have published over 20 papers in prestigious international journals and conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Reliability, The Computer Journal, and Theoretical Computer Science. Currently, as Principal Investigator, I am leading a National Natural Science Foundation Youth Project, a Natural Science Foundation Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, and NJUPT Talent Start-up Funding. I am also involved in multiple National Natural Science Foundation general projects as a key participant.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:
- Data Center Networks
- Cloud Computing and Big Data
- Network Reliability
- Fault-Tolerant Computing
- Graph Theory and Algorithms

I serve as a reviewer for several international journals and conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Theoretical Computer Science, The Computer Journal, and Journal of Supercomputing.
